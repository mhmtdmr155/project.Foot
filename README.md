Hello, I am a frontend developer and have experience with basic technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap related to web design. Additionally, I am constantly updating my skills in designing modern web applications through my proficiency in the Javascript language.

        Throughout my career, I have worked on several projects and become an expert in understanding customer needs and providing aesthetic and user-friendly designs. I am also experienced in responsive design and optimize my designs to provide an excellent viewing experience on mobile devices.
        
        In addition to my technical skills, I place great importance on teamwork and work to achieve our goals by communicating clearly and openly with everyone I work with. I love learning and improving myself, so I always try to gain knowledge about new technologies and trends.
        
        If you would like me to contribute to your project, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you!
